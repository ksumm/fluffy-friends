          Lucy and Lucky came to our shelter as small 4-month-old puppies. Two months later, one family admitted a particular interest in them and confirmed they would like to meet them.

          It was love at first sight. The dogs now live in their lovely home in the suburbs of Limerick.
They have already grown up, and when a baby was born in the family, they became his real friends.
Every morning they patiently wait for a walk in the park with the whole family, and on weekends they are happy to go to the coast with the family.

          Charlie was tracked down on the street as a puppy. We advertised in local newspapers - but never discovered his owners.

          Later, he was trained by Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind as a guide dog. Instantly he is assisting the man with visual disorder to make it easier to move around safely. They come being sincere friends!
